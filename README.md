# bluejay

Over the last few years I've come across many useful, high-quality widgets created by notable Flutter community members and bookmarked them for use. I found that referencing them was difficult, and using them in my projects was tedius - I would have to manually add them into each project. So tedius!

Enter **bluejay** - an organized and well-documented collection of these useful, high-quality widgets.

bluejay makes sure to credit the original developer of each widget
