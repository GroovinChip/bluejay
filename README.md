# bluejay

I often come across useful widgets, extensions, functions, and more. Until now, I have been bookmarking them in my browser, on Twitter, starring on GitHub, etc. It has been difficult to reference them that way, and subsequently frustrating to implement them in my projects. 

**`bluejay`** serves as a curated collection of these useful things.

bluejay is:
* *Opinionated* - `bluejay`'s content is often tailored to my particular needs, requirements, and preferences.
* *Respectful of authors* - Any piece of content not authored by me contains credit to the original author and links to the original posting of that content, if possible.
* *High quality*
* *Organized*
* *Well-documented*
* *Null safe*
